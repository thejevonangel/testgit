# BOOLEAN
# is the idea made by george bool in the 1800s in England that created binary coding using true and false statements
# Normal          boolean (Base 2)
# 0                   0
# 1                     1
# 2                       10
# 3                       11 
# 4                         100

# and he set an entire concept of math based on this.

# boolean algebra worked well for how computers worked in relation to science and this formula

# Now back to loops and conditionalsfor the extensive lesson
